Update the relevant documentation files based on the recent changes.
If any new changes override previous behaviors, remove outdated descriptions and replace them with the new behavior.
For each updated document, ensure the table of contents (TOC) is also updated accordingly—up to heading level 4 (h4).
If new documents are created under `docs/`, make sure those new links are also referred in the `README.md` with a short summary of what those links are. This helps link the `README.md` to in-depth documentation files so that the curious reader can choose to dive deeper in their topic of interest or not.
**DO NOT UDPATE ANY FILES UNDER THE `specs/` FOLDER OR UNDER THE `docs/manual/` FOLDER.**
